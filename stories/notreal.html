        <h2>August 14th</h2>
        <p>A woman who went viral for her bizarre rant on a plane has apologized for her behavior. The woman, who has not been identified, was filmed on video yelling at a flight attendant and passengers, claiming that the man sitting next to her was not real.</p>
        <p>"That mf right there is not real!" she can be heard yelling in the video. "He's a computer generated image! He's not real!"</p>
        <p>The woman continued to rant for several minutes, even after the flight attendant asked her to calm down. She eventually got off the plane at her destination, but not before she had caused a scene.</p>
        <p>The woman's apology video was spread around <a href="x.com" target="_blank">X.com</a>. In the video, she says that she is "deeply sorry" for her behavior and that she was "not in her right mind" at the time.</p>
        <p>"I was having a panic attack and I was not thinking clearly," she says. "I take full responsibility for my actions and I am truly sorry for the pain and embarrassment I caused."</p>
        <p>The woman's apology has been met with mixed reactions online. Some people have accepted her apology, while others have accused her of not being sincere.</p>
        <p>Don't see why she apologized, she screamed on a plane, as if that environment wasn't bad enough, doesn't really change it.</p>
